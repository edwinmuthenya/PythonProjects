The code for this project trys to explain the questions below:
Write a Python program to process a student results at the University undergraduate studies. To print transcripts for the four years and the degree certificate.
(a) Accept the student name, their registration number and the degree program
(b) Accept the academic year (2024/2025, etc), year of study (1, 2, 3, 4), semester (1, 2), course code (SMA3103), course description (Calculus 1), marks and grade (c) The grading system is: A (≥ 70), B (60 − 69), C (50 − 59), D (40 − 49) and E (≤ 39)
(d) Output the results for each year - a transcript with the student name, registration number, degree, year of study with the course description, course code, marks and grade shown based on the semester.
(e) We expect to see four transcripts, each with 10 units per year (Five (5) units every semester)
After completing the above, extend the program to print a certificate based on the following
criteria:
(a) Find the mean score of all the forty units the students has taken during his/her studies for the four years.
(b) Classify the degree as: First class honours (≥ 70), Second upper division (60 − 69), second lower division (50 − 59), pass (40 − 49)
(c) Customize your own certificate to show the student name, degree program, classification, the year of completion and the university name
